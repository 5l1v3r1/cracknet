# cracknet
A .net Crackme Challenge made for the SecTalks Brisbane 2017 CTF Event.

***Intended binary for challenge***: https://github.com/codingo/cracknet/blob/master/ctf.sectalks_bne.crackme/bin/Debug/cracknet.exe

Note that this is a debug build and not a release build, due to compiler instructions. Only the executable needs to be included for the challenge.

## Source Code Notes

The comments at the header of the Program.cs class include intended solution paths and flag. If you wish to solve without sploilers then first compile without reviewing code comments.

Built with v4.5.2 of .Net (https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=42642)
